### Project Description
Managing student leave requests manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Students often face difficulties in tracking the status of their leave requests, and administrators struggle with organizing and approving these requests efficiently. Our Duty Leave Management System aims to streamline this process by providing an easy-to-use platform for students to request leave and for administrators to manage and approve these requests.


### The Problem statement
The manual process of managing student leave requests is inefficient and error-prone. Students have difficulty tracking the status of their leave requests, leading to confusion and delays. Administrators and faculty members face challenges in organizing, reviewing, and approving these requests in a timely manner. This often results in miscommunication and administrative overhead.

### The Solution

Our Duty Leave Management System provides a centralized platform where students can easily submit leave requests and track their status. Administrators and faculty can efficiently manage and approve these requests through role-based dashboards, reducing administrative overhead and improving communication
